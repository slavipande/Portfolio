## Intro

I faced a couple of obstacles in the process of creating my own portfolio website (that you're currently reading through). Once I got it done and reflected a little bit on my experience, I realized how much time I had actually lost trying to navigate through all the content that is available online on the topic of creating tech writing portfolios. I also realized something else - it would've been very, very helpful if I had found a resource on the Internet that guides me step by step through the process of creating the portfolio and answers some technical/tooling questions in the process, too.

## Details

That is why I decided to create a workshop that helps technical writers overcome such technical obstacles that can occur in the process of creating a portfolio. My workshop't title is **Creating a Tech Writing Portfolio with Docs as Code Tooling** and I have already presented it to two technical communication conferences:

- [Evolution of TC](https://evolution-of-tc.com/), June 2023, Sofia

  - screenshot from tekom page of the event
  - what was the feedback (in my own words)

- [tcworld](https://tcworldconference.tekom.de/), November 2023, Stuttgart

  - what was the feedback (in my own words)

The workshop focuses on practical advice and provides a specific solution for the technical obstacles one might face when trying to create a portfolio. In particular, the workshop includes actionable steps that you can take to create a portfolio with a static site generator (Jekyll) and publish the portfolio to the Internet using GitHub Pages:

- find a theme suitable for the use case on GitHub
- for the theme repo
- customize the theme to better suit your needs
- push your changes to GitHub
- enable GitHub Pages and have your site published
- add link validation and spellcheck actions

I've designed the workshop with a single goal in mind: any participant walks away with at least a basic portfolio website published on the Internet. To make sure this is the case, I've prepared several different pieces of content.

- A blog post about required upfront preparation for the workshop: [Creating a Tech Writing Portfolio with Docs as Code Tooling - Preliminary Setup](https://slavipande.github.io/Workshop-TechWritingPortfolio/blog/tcworldworkshop-preliminary-setup).
- An [example repo](https://github.com/slavipande/Workshop-TechWritingPortfolio) that provides the end result of the exercises covered in the workshop. It's [live preview](https://slavipande.github.io/Workshop-TechWritingPortfolio/) is also enabled. I usually encourage participants to fork the repo and enable GitHub pages in case the couldn't follow along the steps during the workshop. 
- An [Exercise Cheat Sheet](https://slavipande.github.io/Workshop-TechWritingPortfolio/exercise-cheat-sheet) that participants can download and follow the steps at their own pace.

- Anything else I might have missed
