I've always been fascinated by technology and curious about how things work. Back in highschool, we'd take printers and monitors to pieces to find out what components they had. In university during my four-year computer science studies, I'd enjoy diving deep into a tech problem or spending days to figure how a tool worked. Although I fully understood the tech concepts and navigated my way through any programming assignments, I never really got into writing code itself. It just wasn't the thing that excited me about technology.

Then I started my first job as a pre-sales engineer. I had to meet clients, understand what their problem was, map it to a solution, and then provide a technical description for the solution. During this time, I started to realize how much I enjoyed writing. 

Afterwards, I switched to writing patent applications for software inventions, which helped me learn more about how software works on the inside and polish my interviewing, writing, and information structuring skills.
Unfortunately, my position in patent application drafting was closed so I decided to pursue a career change. Technical writing was the most logical choice. Many of the day-to-day tasks were similar and a lot of the skills I had gained were transferrable, too. 

My first job as a technical writer involved testing new UI features and directly collaborating with dev teams to ask about functionalities, report issues, and verify UI strings. A few months into the profession, I started realizing that technical writing provided the perfect balance between tech-savviness and writing for me. While upskilling, I learned more about specific tech writing niches and approaches like developer documentation, API docs, docs-as-code, and static site generators. I built my first static site with Jekyll as I was trying to set up a new documentation workflow and introduce better tooling into my work. 

Since then, I've spent significant time creating developer tutorials following a docs-as-code setup and supporting readers with any issues about them. I especially enjoy the collaboration nature of the docs-as-code approach and how easy and seamless it is to get dev input on your docs. The developer documentation realm is a great fit for me and I'm enjoying it big time.
