### Context
 I created this video as part of a bigger project - SAP's [Open Documentation Initiative](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/20/introducing-the-open-documentation-initiative/). The goal was to explain the process step by step and the benefits for all participants. The project also won a prize in a global, company-internal contest for excellence in user assistance.
